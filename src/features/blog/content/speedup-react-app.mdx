Now As a beginner, you don’t need crazy optimizations but these small ones actually help in real projects.


### 1. Lazy loading

- This one is super easy to understand. What you need to understand is that this tells react please dont render my component
or page until user lands there, thats it !

you can see a  little implimentation here


```tsx

const DemoComponent = React.lazy(() => import("./DemoComponent"));

```
You have to add a suspense fallback , it basically shows loading or a placeholder while react renders that specific component.
```tsx

export default function Page() {
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <DemoComponent />
    </React.Suspense>
  );
}

```
This helps when you have big pages or heavy components.


### 2. Image optimizations

You can also lazy load images, or you can use WebP instead of PNG/JPEG or if you are using Next.js, just use the ```<Image />``` component.
This automatically handles resizing, compression, and lazy loading.


### 3. Component re-rendering

React re-renders your component when state changes.
Imagine you have a component where you are updating the state and calling an another heavy component

```tsx

export default function App() {
  const [clicked, setClicked] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={() => 
      setClicked(true)}>click</button>
      <BigHeavyComponent />
    </>
  );
}

```
As you know React will rerender the entire component, and that also includes the heavy component.
We can avoid this by just passing the big component as children into another component.
React doesn’t rerender the children unless its props actually change.

```tsx
export function ChildrenStyleTwo({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
    const [value, setValue] = React.useState(0);
    return (
        <>
            <button
                onClick={() => {
                    setValue((prev) => prev + 1);
                }}
            >
                Increase count: {value}
            </button>
            {children}
        </>
    );
}
```

### 4. Styles object

Same goes for the Inline styles, Inline style objects re-render on every parent render because they create a new object each time.
you can avoid that by assigning a value and then passing it 

```tsx

<Child style={{ color: "red" }} />

```


now if you pass this react does not rerender the childer component passed.

```tsx
const redText = { color: "red" };

<Child style={redText} />

```

These are small things, but if you keep using them, you naturally start writing cleaner and faster React code.

If you reached this far, thank you.
